* Please use **LSE Student Hub** to book slots for office hours.

### Course Information

* **Please send an email** to us with your **GitHub account name or email address (please use a name that does not reveal your identity)** if you would like to have access to the lecture/class materials. For auditing students, you are **not** allowed to attend online or on-campus seminars/classes.
* Lectures will be pre-recorded and uploaded to Moodle, **not** GitHub. 
* Classes will be given via a combination of online and on-campus sessions. 

No lectures or classes will take place during School Reading Week 6.

### Assessment

* Exam (40%, duration: 2 hours, reading time: 10 minutes) in the summer exam period.
* Project (40%, 3000 words) and take-home assessment (20%) in the LT.
* For the take-home assessments, students will be given homework problem sets and computer programming exercises in weeks 2, 4, 7, and 9.
* The project assesment will be in April. The project report should be no fewer than 3000 words and students will be asked to submit ther project reports within one week.
* Students are expected to produce 9 problem sets in the LT, including 4 take-home assessments and 5 formative assignments.

### Some Code/Suggestions for On-Campus Seminar/Class 

[LSE's Student Code for a COVID-Secure Campus](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-relations/assets/documents/pdfs/Student-Code-for-a-COVID-Secure-Campus.pdf)

* **Wear masks** (except if medically exempted) and keep two meters social distancing. We will ask anyone without face coverings to leave the classroom. 
* Get **tested** on LSE campus. Book a test [here](https://info.lse.ac.uk/coronavirus-response/get-tested-at-lse). 
* Please do **not** attend on-campus seminar if tested positive or experiencing COVID symptoms. 
* It is totally fine to **not** attend on-campus seminars if you are worried about COVID. We have online seminar sessions and OHs. Seminar exercises, solutions and recordings will be uploaded online.

### Course Description

The goal of this course is to provide students with a training in foundations of machine learning with a focus on statistical and algorithmic aspects. Students will learn fundamental statistical principles, algorithms, and how to implement and apply machine learning algorithms using the state-of-the-art Python packages such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and OpenAI Gym.

### Organization

The course will involve 20 hours of lectures and 10 hours of computer workshops in the LT.

### Prerequisites

A knowledge of probability and statistical theory to the level of ST102 and ST206 and some parts of ST505 (e.g. linear models and generalized linear models). Some experience with computer programming will be assumed (e.g., Python, R).

### Availability

This course is available on the MPhil/PhD in Statistics. This course is available with permission as an outside option to students on other programmes where regulations permit.

The availability as an outside option requires a demonstration of sufficient background in mathematics and statistics and is at the discretion of the instructor.
